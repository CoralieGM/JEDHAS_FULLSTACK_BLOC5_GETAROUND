Welcome to GETAROUND prediction API

GetAround is the Airbnb for cars. You can rent cars from any person for a few hours to a few days! Founded in 2009, this company has known rapid growth. In 2019, they count over 5 million users and about 20K available cars worldwide.

We worked on price optimization. Thanks to automatic learning, we propose you the optimal prices for the owner of the cars to rent !

Here are two endpoints you can try:

## Preview

Simply returns preview of the dataset!

* `/preview` here you can have a preview of the cars pricing dataset


## Prediction

This is a Machine Learning endpoint that predict price given some car's informations. Here is the endpoint:

* `/predict` put your cars informations here and you'll get you rental price per day


Check out documentation below ðŸ‘‡ for more information on each endpoint.
